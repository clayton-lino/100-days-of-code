# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Started the Odin Project and did my first commit and pull right here!

**Time Spent** Today I'd spent  **2:08h** I've used [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to count that!

**Thoughts:** After days of research, I decide myself to going through a back-end way, I'm excited to start to learn Ruby On Rails! I think that I will have to get a hard knowledge in CS if a want to be good, I found the CS50 course from Harvard and it looks great I will definitely try in the next days!
